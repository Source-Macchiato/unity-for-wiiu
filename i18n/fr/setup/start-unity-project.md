Creation of the Unity project and configuration.

## Creation of the Unity project

After configuring your development environment you can now launch Unity Hub and create a new project. Select the 3D template, choose a name, a path and now let's go to the project configuration.

## Configuration

### Unity Preferences

In the 'Edit' category click on the 'Unity Preferences' button then select your code editor from the 'External Script Editor' drop-down menu. For the 'Wii U SDK Location' dropdown change 'CAFE_ROOT' to the path to your Wii U SDK which should be 'C:\Nintendo\SDK\SDK\cafe_sdk'. And finally for the 'MULTI Location' drop-down menu select the path to the 'multi5324' folder that we placed in 'C:\ghs\multi5324'.
