# Starting the Unity project

Creation of the Unity project and configuration.

## Creation of the Unity project

After configuring your development environment, you may now launch Unity Hub and create a new project. Select the 3D template, choose a name & path.

Disregard any errors, as we will fix them in the next section.

## Configuration

### Unity Preferences

At the top left of Unity, click `Edit > Preferences...`. Set the properties as followed:

`Wii U SDK Location` as `C:\Nintendo\SDK\SDK\cafe_sdk`
`MULTI Location`     as `C:\ghs\multi5324`

Optionally, you may select your IDE, such as Visual Studio, as the `External Script Editor`.
