# Installing Unity

## Gathering prerequisites

- [Unity](https://archive.org/download/unityforwiiu40120171205/UnityforWiiU-4_0_1-20171205.zip)
- [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/unity-hub)

Extract `UnityforWiiU-4_0_1-20171205.zip` once downloaded, and install the programs as followed **in order**:

1. `UnityforWiiU-4_0_1-20171205.exe`
2. `UnityforWiiU-4_0_1-WiiUSupport-20171205.exe`

Install & log into Unity Hub, but **do not** install any Unity version if it prompts you to. **This can completely brick Unity and you will have to reinstall Windows!**

## Activating Unity
**Do not use Unity for this or your web browser. Use Unity Hub.**

- Login to your Unity account in Unity Hub,
- Click on your account's profile picture at the top left,
- Navigate to "Manage licenses",
- Click on "Add", and select "Activate with serial number",
- Finally, use the following serial number: `I3-K6SY-99ZB-JYFZ-DZQP-E8PH`
