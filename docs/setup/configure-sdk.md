## Downloading files

- [Wii U SDK archive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C8Bggyo62wdylBdlgVtCbvnxFWY-ChvX/view?usp=sharing)
- [ghs folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wJjiMcQh6HvnvstloE_zlvX0ojZo8p_A/view?usp=sharing)

## Installation

### Nintendo Dev Interface

- After downloading the Nintendo Dev Interface installation file, install it and leave the default options.
- Then open the software, login to your Nintendo developer account and select "Dev Environments".
- Click on "Add Environment" and then on "Create From Archive".
- Search your PC for the MegaZarf file (the archive you previously downloaded) and leave the default installation location.

### ghs folder

Now you need to extract the "ghs" folder to your C:\ drive. The final path must be "C:\ghs\".

### Environment variables

You must then find the "Nintendo\CafeSDK\SDK\cafe_sdk" folder and launch the "cafex_env.bat" file.
